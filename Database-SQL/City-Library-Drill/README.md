Write about objective, tools, steps taken and results

City Library Drill:

Objective - Create a database schema for a library management based on a flow chart provided by the Tech Academy.

Tools - Using SQL Server 2008, newly acquired knowledge of SQL and databases and a flow chart with different tables,
fields and keys, take your limited amount of information, fill each table with dummy information and make it so that you
can complete a series of inquiries.

This was the first truly challenging assignment that I faced at The Tech Academy. My first task was to create the various tables
using SQL Server 2008. After that I had to properly assign primary and secondary keys in each table so that the tables could
properly connect and that all data on a key was properly provided and connected to other tables. Though SQL is a very high level language, completing this assignment required proper organization, understanding of syntax and the ability to logically plan out
a series of steps to have a complete and functioning piece of code. In the end all inquiries were launched successfully.
